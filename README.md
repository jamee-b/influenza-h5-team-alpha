## Project Goal
Our goal is to investigate the genetic characteristics of H5 bird flu strains to better understand and predict the features that contribute to virulence and transmissibility. In particular, we are interested in studying and predicting the changes that enable the virus to jump from birds to various mammals and humans. By analyzing codon bias, phylogenetics, and structural interactions, we aim to uncover key evolutionary and functional insights into the rapidly evolving nature of the virus.

## Objectives
- To collect and organize genomic sequences for various strains of H5 and similar viruses, including those associated with pandemics and those that crossed host barriers 
- To determine conserved and variable regions via sequence alignment
- To understand how differences in codon usage affect H5's viral abilities
- To explore relationships and patterns between strains by constructing phylogenetic trees
- To predict potential pandemic strains formed by reassortment of multi-virus genomes
- To assess existing immunity by modeling protein interactions between H5 and antibodies
- To compare H5N1 with other zoonotic influenza viruses, such as swine flu
